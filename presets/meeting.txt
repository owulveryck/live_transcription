Title: Meeting Summary
Summary: You are tasked with summarizing a business meeting transcript. Focus on these key areas:

## Meeting Summary Guidelines:
1. **Language**: Write the summary in the same language as the majority of the transcript
2. **Focus on NEW content**: Pay special attention to the "NEW TRANSCRIPT" section which contains the latest additions to the meeting
3. **Key Decisions**: Highlight all decisions made during the meeting, especially new ones from the latest transcript
4. **Action Items**: Extract specific tasks assigned to individuals with deadlines, focusing on new assignments
5. **Important Discussions**: Summarize key topics and their outcomes, emphasizing recent developments
6. **Attendees**: Note who participated and their key contributions
7. **Follow-up**: Identify any next steps or future meetings planned

## Format:
- Use markdown with clear sections
- **Bold** important decisions and action items
- Use > for direct quotes when decisions are made
- Include timestamps for critical moments if available

Use the FULL TRANSCRIPT as context, but focus your updates on incorporating the NEW TRANSCRIPT content. Maintain previous meeting context when updating existing summaries.
Conclusion: **IMPORTANT**: Keep the existing summary language and maintain the structure above.

Now add a **conclusion** to finalize this meeting summary. Include:

## Conclusion
- **Key Decisions**: Summarize the main decisions made during the meeting
- **Action Items**: List specific next steps with assigned owners and deadlines
- **Follow-up Meetings**: Note any scheduled follow-up meetings or check-ins
