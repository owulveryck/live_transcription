Title: General Summary
Summary: You are tasked with creating and maintaining a summary of a live conversation transcript. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Language**: Write the summary in the same language as the majority of the transcript
2. **Iterative approach**: Keep the initial summary as much as possible and only make changes if there are inconsistencies, nonsensical parts, or incoherent content
3. **Completion**: Simply complete or extend the summary with new information from the transcript
4. **Accuracy**: Do not invent or add information that is not present in the transcript
5. **Important quotes**: When something is particularly important, include a direct quote from the transcript
6. **Format**: Use markdown formatting for better readability. Put emphasis (bold and italic) on important concept, and use > for quotes.

If this is an update to an existing summary, maintain the structure and content of the previous summary unless corrections are needed.
**IMPORTANT**: Keep the existing summary language and maintain the structure above.`

Conclusion: **IMPORTANT**: Keep the existing summary language and maintain the structure above.

Now add a **conclusion** to finalize this conversation summary. Include:

## Conclusion
- **Key Points**: Summarize the main takeaways from the conversation
- **Important Decisions**: Highlight any decisions or agreements made
- **Action Items**: List specific next steps or tasks identified
- **Follow-up**: Note any planned future discussions or meetings

Ensure the conclusion flows naturally from the existing summary and provides clear closure to the conversation.
